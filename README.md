# RuRoommates?

  This application gives users a more interactive and efficient way to find roommates at Rowan University. By orienting the app around user to user interaction, it gives a more personable manner to find potential matches, rather than the system currently in place by the university. 
	When the user creates an account they will fill out a general roommate questionnaire consisting of sleeping habits, social life, and basic expectations to model the candidates they would be best suited for. Along with this information, there will be the option to personalize the users profile with social media, an about me bio, and other traits to further depict themselves. The app will match people based on the percentage of common answers on the questionnaire between users. The app will then add the match to the pool of potential roommate candidates for the user to reach out to.
